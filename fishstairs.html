            <h2>STAIRS</h2>
            <p>a painted stairway that transforms everyday urban <br> infrastructure into a vibrant work of public art. <br> Located on Arany János street, the staircase leads <br>down to Tapolca’s picturesque Malom (Mill) Lake, <br> seamlessly connecting the town’s natural setting <br> with its creative spirit</p>

            <p class="timeline-intro">In 2016 Judit Varjas worked from dawn until <br> night for 16 days and used 30 kilograms of <br>paint to decorate the 27 steps. This work of art <br> was refreshed in the autumn of 2022. The <br> repair work took twenty-two 10-12-hour days, <br> made difficult by bad weather. The result, <br>however, speaks for itself.</p>

            <h2>KOI FISH</h2>
            <p>The design centers on koi fish symbolic residents <br> of the nearby lake, swimming through waves of <br> vibrant blues and teals that ripple across the risers. <br> This aquatic theme blurs the line between the local <br> environment and the art itself: as visitors ascend or <br>descend the stairs, they feel almost as if they are <br> moving through water, guided by schools of fish.</p>
